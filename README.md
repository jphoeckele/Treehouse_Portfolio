# Treehouse_Portfolio

This portfolio was created while using TeamTreehouse's HTML tutorial. It was an 8 hour course that I used as a refresher. It covered html, css, and tips on creating a mobile responsive website. It is nothing spectacular but did help me to solidify some of the basics. Practice, practice, practice!
